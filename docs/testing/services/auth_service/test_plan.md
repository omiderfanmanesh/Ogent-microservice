# Auth Service Test Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive testing approach for the Ogent platform's Auth Service, which is responsible for authentication, authorization, and user management.

## Service Overview

The Auth Service is built using PHP/Laravel and provides the following key functionalities:
- User authentication (login/logout)
- User registration and account management
- Role-based access control
- Password management (reset, change)
- JWT token generation and validation
- Session management

## Test Environments

| Environment | URL | Database | Purpose |
|-------------|-----|----------|---------|
| Development | http://auth-service.dev.ogent.local | auth_dev | Developer testing |
| Test | http://auth-service.test.ogent.local | auth_test | Automated testing |
| Staging | http://auth-service.staging.ogent.local | auth_staging | Pre-production validation |
| Production | https://auth.ogent.com | auth_prod | Live system |

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on individual components and methods within the Auth Service.

| Test Area | Description | Tools |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| User Repository | Test CRUD operations for user management | PHPUnit |
| Auth Controller | Test controller methods and validation | PHPUnit |
| JWT Service | Test token generation, validation, and expiration | PHPUnit |
| Password Service | Test password hashing and validation | PHPUnit |
| Role Management | Test role assignment and permission checking | PHPUnit |

### 2. Integration Tests

Integration tests verify the interaction between components and external dependencies.

| Test Area | Description | Tools |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Database Integration | Test ORM and query functionality | PHPUnit + TestDatabase |
| Cache Integration | Test Redis caching for tokens | PHPUnit + Redis |
| Email Integration | Test password reset email delivery | Mailhog + PHPUnit |
| API Gateway Integration | Test communication with API Gateway | Laravel HTTP Client |

### 3. API Tests

API tests validate the external interfaces exposed by the Auth Service.

| Endpoint | HTTP Method | Test Cases |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| /api/auth/login | POST | Valid credentials, invalid credentials, account locked, rate limiting |
| /api/auth/register | POST | Valid registration, duplicate email, validation errors |
| /api/auth/logout | POST | Valid token, expired token, blacklisted token |
| /api/auth/refresh | POST | Valid refresh token, expired refresh token |
| /api/auth/forgot-password | POST | Valid email, non-existent email |
| /api/auth/reset-password | POST | Valid token, expired token, password complexity |
| /api/users/{id} | GET | Authorized access, unauthorized access, non-existent user |
| /api/users/{id} | PUT | Valid update, validation errors, unauthorized update |
| /api/roles | GET | List all roles, role permissions |

### 4. Security Tests

Security tests focus on identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring proper security controls.

| Test Area | Description | Tools |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Authentication Bypass | Attempt to bypass authentication mechanisms | OWASP ZAP |
| SQL Injection | Test input fields for SQL injection vulnerabilities | SQLmap |
| XSS Protection | Verify protection against cross-site scripting | OWASP ZAP |
| CSRF Protection | Verify CSRF token implementation | Manual testing |
| Rate Limiting | Test protection against brute force attacks | Custom scripts |
| Token Security | Verify token encryption and secure transmission | Manual inspection |
| Password Storage | Verify secure password hashing | Manual inspection |

### 5. Performance Tests

Performance tests evaluate the service's behavior under load.

| Test Scenario | Description | Target Metrics | Tools |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Login Performance | Simulate multiple concurrent login requests | <200ms response time, <1% error rate | JMeter |
| Token Validation | Test token validation performance | <50ms per validation | JMeter |
| User Creation | Test user registration performance | <500ms per registration | k6 |
| Database Scaling | Test performance with increasing database size | Linear scaling up to 1M users | Custom scripts |

## Test Data Management

- Development/Test: Anonymized user data with predefined test accounts
- Staging: Subset of production data with sensitive information masked
- Test data includes various account states: active, locked, pending verification

## Automated Test Execution

| Test Type | Trigger | Frequency | Success Criteria |
|-----------|---------|-----------|------------------|
| Unit & Integration Tests | Pull Request | Every PR | 100% pass rate |
| API Tests | Merge to main | Daily | 100% pass rate |
| Security Tests | Scheduled | Weekly | No high/critical findings |
| Performance Tests | Scheduled | Bi-weekly | Meeting target metrics |

## Test Scripts and Examples

### Example Unit Test: User Repository

```php
public function testCreateUser()
{
    $userData = [
        'name' => 'Test User',
        'email' => 'test@example.com',
        'password' => 'securePassword123!'
    ];
    
    $user = $this->userRepository->create($userData);
    
    $this->assertInstanceOf(User::class, $user);
    $this->assertEquals($userData['name'], $user->name);
    $this->assertEquals($userData['email'], $user->email);
    $this->assertTrue(Hash::check($userData['password'], $user->password));
}
```

### Example API Test: Login Endpoint

```php
public function testSuccessfulLogin()
{
    // Create a test user
    $user = User::factory()->create([
        'email' => 'testlogin@example.com',
        'password' => Hash::make('password123')
    ]);
    
    $response = $this->postJson('/api/auth/login', [
        'email' => 'testlogin@example.com',
        'password' => 'password123'
    ]);
    
    $response->assertStatus(200)
        ->assertJsonStructure([
            'access_token',
            'token_type',
            'expires_in'
        ]);
}

public function testFailedLogin()
{
    $response = $this->postJson('/api/auth/login', [
        'email' => 'nonexistent@example.com',
        'password' => 'wrongpassword'
    ]);
    
    $response->assertStatus(401)
        ->assertJson([
            'message' => 'Invalid credentials'
        ]);
}
```

## Test Reporting

- Test results are published to the CI/CD dashboard
- Failed tests block deployment to higher environments
- Weekly test summary reports are generated for stakeholders
- Code coverage reports track test coverage trends

## Defect Management

- Defects are logged in the issue tracking system with priority levels
- Critical security defects trigger immediate notifications
- Regression tests are created for all fixed defects
- Weekly defect triage meetings review open issues

## Test Team and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| Lead Developer | Maintain unit tests, review test plans |
| QA Engineer | Create and execute integration and API tests |
| Security Engineer | Conduct security testing and vulnerability assessments |
| DevOps Engineer | Manage test environments and performance testing |
