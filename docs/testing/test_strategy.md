# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Ogent platform, providing a comprehensive approach to ensuring the quality and reliability of the system.

## Testing Levels

### Unit Testing
- **Scope**: Individual components and functions
- **Tools**: PHPUnit for PHP, pytest for Python, Jest for JavaScript
- **Responsibility**: Developers
- **Automation**: Integrated with CI/CD pipeline

### Integration Testing
- **Scope**: Interactions between components and services
- **Tools**: API testing frameworks, database interaction tests
- **Responsibility**: QA team and developers
- **Automation**: Regular scheduled runs in test environment

### System Testing
- **Scope**: End-to-end functionality across the entire platform
- **Tools**: Postman collections, Cypress
- **Responsibility**: QA team
- **Automation**: Daily runs in staging environment

### Performance Testing
- **Scope**: System performance under load
- **Tools**: JMeter, k6
- **Responsibility**: DevOps and QA team
- **Automation**: Weekly runs and before major releases

## Testing Categories

### Functional Testing
- Authentication and authorization
- Command execution workflows
- User management
- Real-time communication
- API contracts validation

### Non-Functional Testing
- **Performance**: Response times, throughput, resource usage
- **Security**: Vulnerability scans, penetration testing
- **Usability**: User interface testing, accessibility
- **Reliability**: Failover testing, fault injection

### Regression Testing
- Automated test suite runs after each code change
- Focus on critical paths and previously identified issues
- Smoke tests run on every deployment

## Testing Environments

1. **Development**
   - Purpose: Developer testing
   - Data: Anonymized subset of production data
   - Deployment: On-demand

2. **Test**
   - Purpose: QA and automated testing
   - Data: Comprehensive test data set
   - Deployment: Daily builds

3. **Staging**
   - Purpose: Pre-production validation
   - Data: Production-like data
   - Deployment: After QA approval

4. **Production**
   - Purpose: Live system
   - Data: Real data
   - Deployment: After staging validation

## Test Automation Strategy

- **CI/CD Integration**: Tests integrated with GitHub Actions
- **Test Prioritization**: Critical paths tested first
- **Parallel Execution**: Tests run in parallel when possible
- **Reporting**: Automated test reports and dashboards
- **Maintenance**: Regular review and update of test cases

## Service-Specific Testing Strategies

Detailed testing strategies for specific services are documented separately:

- [Auth Service Test Plan](/testing/services/auth_service/test_plan.md)
- Command Execution Service Test Plan
- Agent Service Test Plan
- Socket Service Test Plan

## Best Practices

1. Follow the testing pyramid approach (more unit tests, fewer UI tests)
2. Maintain test independence to allow parallel execution
3. Use consistent test data management
4. Practice test-driven development (TDD) for new features
5. Implement continuous testing as part of CI/CD
6. Monitor test coverage and set minimum thresholds

## Test Documentation

All tests should be documented with:
- Purpose of the test
- Prerequisites
- Test steps
- Expected results
- Actual results
- Pass/fail criteria

## Review and Improvement

The testing strategy is subject to regular review and improvement:
- Quarterly review of testing effectiveness
- Adjustment based on defect analysis
- Updates to accommodate new technologies and methodologies
