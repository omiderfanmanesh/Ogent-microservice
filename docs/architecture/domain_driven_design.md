# Domain-Driven Design in Ogent Microservices

## Overview

This document outlines the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles applied in the Ogent microservices architecture.

## Core DDD Concepts

### Bounded Contexts

The Ogent system is divided into several bounded contexts, each represented by a microservice:

1. **Authentication Context** (auth-service)
   - Manages user identity, authentication, and authorization

2. **Agent Context** (langchain-agent)
   - Handles AI agent creation, configuration, and execution

3. **Command Execution Context** (command-execution)
   - Manages secure command execution and monitoring

4. **Notification Context** (socket-service)
   - Handles real-time updates and notifications

### Domain Layer Organization

Each service should follow a consistent structure:

```
/app
  /domain           # Domain layer
    /entities       # Domain entities and value objects
    /repositories   # Repository interfaces
    /services       # Domain services
  /infrastructure   # Infrastructure layer (DB, external services)
  /api              # Application layer (controllers, DTOs)
  /core             # Cross-cutting concerns
```

### Ubiquitous Language

The system uses a consistent vocabulary across all services:

- **Agent**: An AI entity capable of executing tasks
- **Execution**: A single run of an agent with a specific input
- **Command**: A system command to be executed
- **User**: An authenticated entity interacting with the system

## Domain Model

### Entities

- **User**: A user of the system with authentication credentials
- **Agent**: An AI entity with specific capabilities and configuration
- **Execution**: A record of an agent's execution run
- **Command**: A system command with execution details

### Value Objects

- **AgentConfiguration**: Configuration for an agent
- **AgentPermissions**: Security settings for an agent
- **ExecutionStatus**: Status of an execution run
- **CommandResult**: Result of a command execution

### Repositories

- **UserRepository**: Manages user persistence
- **AgentRepository**: Manages agent persistence
- **ExecutionRepository**: Manages execution persistence
- **CommandRepository**: Manages command persistence

## Service Communication

Services communicate through:

1. **API Gateway**: REST API calls routed through the gateway
2. **Events**: Asynchronous events for cross-service communication
3. **Shared Contracts**: Common data structures for service integration

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Test domain logic in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test repository implementations
- **Service Tests**: Test API endpoints and service boundaries
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user scenarios across services
